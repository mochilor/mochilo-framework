# mochilo-framework
A small php framework I use on my personal website and several other pages. 

It's intended for small websites with no database usage (static webs). It offers several features thanks to some cool libraries:

- [Twig](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig) template system.
- [php-DI](https://github.com/PHP-DI/PHP-DI) as dependency injection container.
- [alto router](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter) for simple url routing.
- [phpmailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) as mail system.
- [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) for loading environment variables.
